xivdatabase
===========
This is my code for the MIT OCW: "Introduction to C++" final project. It is an in-memory console database program, designed to store and display FFXIV:ARR game items. It is here both for my own reference, and as a basic example of what I can accomplish in a short time with a new language. Features include: templates, STL, custom classes (and derived classes), virtual methods, and memory management.
